# SushiPus

**A creative game developed for the TapTap Spotlight GameJam.**  
SushiPus is a collaborative game project created during a one-month online game jam, focusing on playful mechanics, system-driven gameplay, and rapid iteration under real production constraints.

**Created for:**  
TapTap Spotlight GameJam (1-month development period)

## About This Project
*SushiPus* was developed by a **six-person team** as part of the TapTap Spotlight GameJam.  
The project was completed within a **one-month intensive development cycle**, emphasizing teamwork, rapid prototyping, and efficient implementation.

The game was featured as an official entry on TapTap’s Spotlight GameJam platform.

## Theme & Concept — “Isn’t This a Bug?”

*SushiPus* is inspired by the myth of **Sisyphus** and the repetitive nature of conveyor-belt sushi restaurants, where every piece of sushi is destined to be eaten in an endless loop.

The game asks a simple question: **what if one piece of sushi refused its fate?**  
Players control an “awakened” sushi that survives by behaving like a *bug* inside the system — exploiting gaps, unintended spaces, and environmental oversights to escape.

> *Am I merely a sushi meant to be consumed, or something that chooses to exist?*

## My Role & Contributions
Although developed as a team project, I served as the **primary Unity developer**, responsible for the majority of the technical implementation and production integration.

### Programming & Technical Implementation
- Implemented **all core gameplay systems** in Unity using C#
- Responsible for:
  - Scene setup and configuration across the entire project
  - Gameplay logic and interaction systems
  - System integration and debugging
- Created and integrated **custom shaders** for specific scene elements

### Unity Integration & Production
- Fully handled **Unity scene assembly**, including:
  - Prefab setup
  - Lighting configuration
  - Camera setup
  - Gameplay-object placement
- Integrated team-provided assets (illustrations, frame animations, audio, music) into the game
- Ensured consistency between design intent and in-game behavior

### 3D Environment & Art Pipeline
- Co-created the game environment using **Blender** in collaboration with teammates
- Responsible for importing, configuring, and optimizing 3D assets inside Unity

### Game Design & Collaboration
- Participated in **gameplay and mechanic design discussions** as part of the team
- Helped translate shared design ideas into playable systems through implementation

### Promotion & Presentation
- Responsible for **game promotion and presentation**, including:
  - Writing promotional copy
  - Editing and producing the gameplay video
  - Preparing materials for the TapTap GameJam submission page

## Technical Highlights
- Developed in **Unity** using **C#**
- Full ownership of:
  - Scene configuration and system integration
  - Gameplay logic implementation
  - Custom shader creation for scene-specific visual effects
- Demonstrates:
  - Ability to execute and integrate team designs into a complete playable build
  - Strong understanding of Unity production workflows
  - Experience working under real-world time constraints

## Project Scope
This repository focuses on **gameplay code, scene configuration, and technical implementation**.  
Assets such as illustrations, animations, and audio were created by team members and integrated during development.

## Development Context
- Team size: 6
- Development duration: ~1 month
- Project type: GameJam / rapid prototyping
- Platform: TapTap (Spotlight GameJam)
